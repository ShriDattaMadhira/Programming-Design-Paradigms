# DESCRIPTION

We create a basic design for a game of Tic Tac Toe. For our purposes, the game grid cells are numbered by row and column starting at 0. For example, the upper left position is row 0, column 0 (or [0][0] in the 2D array returned by getBoard(). The upper middle position is row 0, column 1 ([0][1]), the lower right is [2][2].

Implemented the model and tests that will ensure that the model not only CAN work but that it WILL ALWAYS work.
