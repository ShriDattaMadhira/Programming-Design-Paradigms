# DESCRIPTION

In console-based game play, a single move consists of two numbers, specifying the row and column of the intended move position. 
Board positions for these moves are numbered from 1. For example, to mark a X in the upper left cell, the user would enter "1 1" at the first prompt. 
To mark O in the upper right cell on the second move, the user would enter "1 3". To quit a game in progress, the user can enter q or Q at any time.

Implemented a console-based version of Tic Tac Toe and tests that will ensure that the model not only CAN work but that it WILL ALWAYS work.
