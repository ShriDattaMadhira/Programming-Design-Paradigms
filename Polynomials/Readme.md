# DESCRIPTION
A polynomial is made of several terms, each term having a coefficient and a variable raised to a power. 
Polynomials are one-variable if all their terms contain only one variable. An example of such a polynomial is 𝑓(𝑥)=3𝑥^4−5𝑥^3+2𝑥−4. This polynomial has four terms.

The degree of a polynomial is defined as the highest power of the variable in a term. In the above example, the degree of the polynomial is 4. 
The polynomials we deal with have only non-negative whole numbers as powers. The coefficients of our polynomials are integral numbers.

Two polynomials are the same if they contain the same terms.

Several algebraic operations are possible with polynomials. The simplest one is evaluating the polynomial for a specific value of the variable. 
For example, for a polynomial 𝑓(𝑥)=3𝑥^4−5𝑥^3+2𝑥−4, its value at 𝑥=2.5 is defined as 𝑓(2.5)=3(2.5)^4−5(2.5)^3+2∗(2.5)−4 which is 40.0625.

Polynomials can be added together to create a new polynomial. 
The addition is performed by combining all the terms and adding the coefficients of the terms with the same power. 
For example (3𝑥4−5𝑥3+2𝑥−4)+(2𝑥3+2𝑥2+4) is 3𝑥^4−3𝑥^3+2𝑥^2+2𝑥. The degree of the sum is the maximum of the degrees of the two polynomials.
