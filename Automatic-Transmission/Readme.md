# DESCRIPTION

A car's transmission controls how much the rotation of an engine affects the rotation of the axels By controlling the gear, the transmission prevents the car from speeding up too much when the engine is revved up. This is important for a smoothly running car. 

Cars with a manual transmission require the driver to change gears as they are changing speed. 
Cars with automatic transmission by let the car's computer choose how much rotation to transfer at certain speeds. Since cars cannot have negative speed (but can go as fast as their engines allow), this choice of gear is a monotonically increasing function of speed.
In this lab, you will be simulating this in a computer program. Cars cannot have a negative speed, but can go as fast as needed.
