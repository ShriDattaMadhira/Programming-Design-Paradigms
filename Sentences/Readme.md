# DESCRIPTION
A sentence in English is made of a series of words and punctuation in a particular sequence. In this assignment, you must represent a sentence as a recursive union.

1. Words in the sentence are represented one word per WordNode.
2. Punctuation in the sentence is represented one punctuation per PunctuationNode. 
3. Punctuation can appear one after the other (without spaces in between them).
4. The end of the sentence is represented by a special EmptyNode.

Designed and implemented a solution for a Sentence in English using recursive unions in Java.
